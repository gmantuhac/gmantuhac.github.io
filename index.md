# About me!

Hello everyone! I am *Giovanni Jericho Mantuhac*. I prefer to be called **Gio** because my first name always feels long to introduce to people. 

Welcome to my page! To start off, I am an undergraduate student at the [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) studying [Mathematics-Computer Science](https://math.ucsd.edu/students/undergraduate/ma30-math-computer-science-b-s/). I came from a mid-size town called [Salinas, California](https://goo.gl/maps/9GdQRhixtecGmD4V6). I find myself motivated to work hard on my academics to ensure that I am fully getting the most of my education. 

I chose to study Mathematics-Computer Science because I genuinely enjoyed and excelled in mathematics since elementary school. As a means to grow towards this adapting world, I specifically chose Mathematics-Computer Science so that I am able to apply any relating skills from computer science into my future, whether it may be applicable or theoretical. In fact, since my initial coding experience at UC San Diego, I am really enjoying programming and am becomming more confident in a career field towards research or a career field towards the industry.

I have been appointed as an Instructional Assistant in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of California San Diego. I will be tutoring **CSE 8A: Introduction to Programming and Computational Problem-Solving I** for Winter 2023.

I tutored CSE 8A in Fall 2022, here is the [course website](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/cse8afall2022/home) and here is my [evaluation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DWDbvCpSdm2Vvc9-UUA3T7Tp1sVlZbeJ/view?usp=sharing) from students. Keep in mind, this form is not an evaluation from *all* the students I tutored, only the ones that decided to evaluate me in their free time.

## Skills
---
From general coding experience, I am proficient in he use of Python and Java. I am experienced in aspects of UNIX, Vim, and general debugging strategies. Next, I will be learning **C and Assembly**.

From general mathmatical experience, I am proficient in undergraduate levels of Calculus I, II, and III, Linear Algebra, Ordinary Differential Equations, and Vector Calculus. Next, I will be learning an **Introduction to Mathematical Proofs**.

In my profession in working at my positions in *UC San Diego Housing, Dining, and Hospitality* and *dd's Discounts*, I have learned useful applicable skills such as multitasking, leading a group of people, training new individuals, providing food with a positive attitude, having the ability to be quick on my feet, managing through a rush of patrons, maintaining an atmosphere of cleanliness in my area etc.

## Hobbies
---
I love gaming. Video games have been a large part of my life since I was a young child. The oldest system I ever owned was a Sega Dreamcast, although I barely have any memories playing the system. As of now, I mainly play games on my laptop and on my Playstation 4 but I am noticing that I am getting *less and less* time to play either. When given some kind of artistic-*esque* assignment, I find that much of my inspiration comes from video games. If you want a suggestion for a video game, I highly suggest my favorite, [Persona 5 Royal](https://youtu.be/vWWy7V9rCrA).

I also love watching anime. However, like video games, I am finding *less and less* time to watch any anime. If you want a suggestion, I highly reccomend watching my favorite, [Assassination Classroom](https://myanimelist.net/anime/24833/Ansatsu_Kyoushitsu?q=assassin&cat=anime).
